Heart's on fire, leaving all behind
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you

Step outside, gonna step outside, I'm gonna step outside
Heart's on fire in the warming rain

Living life feeding appetites
Stake through every heart stop in the mood
Being glad, breathing appetite

Heart's on fire, leaving all behind
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you

Step outside, gonna step outside, I'm gonna step outside

Broke tooth one day, something's not the same
Blank head, that guy sweep the floor
Feel your presence in your absence, shut the door

Heart's on fire, leaving all behind
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you
